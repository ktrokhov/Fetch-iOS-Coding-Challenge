# Fetch-iOS-Coding-Challenge
Fetch - iOS Coding Challenge
Please write a native iOS app that allows users to browse recipes using the following API:<br>

https://themealdb.com/api.php<br>

There are 2 endpoints that your app should utilize:<br>
• https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert for fetching the list of meals in the Dessert category.<br>
• https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID for fetching the meal details by its ID.

The user should be shown the list of meals in the Dessert category, sorted alphabetically.<br>
When the user selects a meal, they should be taken to a detail view that includes:<br>
  • Meal name<br>
  • Instructions<br>
  • Ingredients/measurements<br>
  
Please read the following guidelines carefully before starting the coding challenge:<br>
  • Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.<br>
  • UI/UX design is not what you’re being evaluated on, but the app should be user friendly and should take basic app design principles into account.<br>
  • Project should compile using the latest version of Xcode.<br>
